## Reading Data

In this session, we will learn how to read data from a file and from a database using the BrAPI Helper.

### 1. Reading data from a local file (explore on your own)

We will upload a file to the platform and read it using R. The file `phenotype_test_data_workshop.csv` is available [here](data/phenotype_test_data_workshop.csv). The notebook is available here: [demo_1_Read_File.ipynb](demo_1_Read_File.ipynb).

### 2. Reading data from using the BrAPI Helper (live demo)
    
We will launch this demo on ILCI's Crop Improvement Analytics Platform by following [this link](https://ciap.ilci.scienceversa.com/hub/user-redirect/git-pull?repo=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fagostof%2FILCI-CIAP-Workshops&urlpath=lab%2Ftree%2FILCI-CIAP-Workshops%2FOnboarding_20240703%2F03_reading_data%2Fdemo_2_BrAPI_Helper.ipynb&branch=main). Continue on the platform, where the demo will open in a new tab.

This will open the `BrAPI Helper` demo instructions [demo_2_BrAPI_Helper.ipynb](demo_2_BrAPI_Helper.ipynb) notebook. (**authorized users only**).
